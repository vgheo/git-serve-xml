Functional test - serve html/xml/xsl files from a git repo using http

## gitweb
- ISSUE: URLs used to acces files are not hierarchical - so releative links cannot be resolved

##  gitlist
v0.5.0
- DOES have hierarchical URLS - relative links are resolved
- ISSUE- implementation serves raw files with http header content-type:text/plain
- HACK - change the implementation - force  to text/xml
    - WORKS for XML+XSL
    - limitation : ALL files are handled as xml 
        => html files are not displayed properly
